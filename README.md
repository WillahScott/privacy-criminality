# Privacy vs. Criminality

The following repo contains the research performed by [Nina](https://github.com/kuknina) & [Will](https://github.com/WillahScott) on the availability of public criminal records.  

## Goal + Summary

The project started out with the goal of identifying inside traders (from the public SEC filings) through social media, such as LinkedIn, and performing analysis on possible matches with political campaign donors (obtained as well from the public listings).  

Unsuccesful attempts at identifying these insider traders and finding matches with the political financial donors led us to end up guiding our research to a much more qualitative work than our initial intentions. We ended up reviewing numerous sources of public listings of criminals throughout multiple states and counties. This led us to the realization of the unjust and unfair state of affairs for public criminal data between states or even counties, which could have potential detrimental causes on ex-criminals, accused incumbents, or even innocent bystanders that may share a name with charged individuals.  

For the full summary of our findings refer to the [report](/report/InsiderTraderandPubliclyAvailableCriminalInformation.pdf).
